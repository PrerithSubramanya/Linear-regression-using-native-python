# Linear-regression-using-native-python
Write linear regression model using python, import the class module to call the fit and predict functions.
# step 1
open editors like py charm :- copy the lr_function_call code to new file.
# step 2 
copy the lr_model_class.
 # note : while importing the class make sure the name of the class function is same.
The model is built on airfoil pressure prediction. This model is suitable for any linear regression problem.
